# üåê AWS Route 53 ‚Äì Routing Policy Projects

Welcome to the complete hands-on repository on **AWS Route 53 Routing Policies**. This collection of practicals demonstrates the working and configuration of various routing techniques used to manage DNS in cloud environments.

## üìå Objective

The objective of this project is to practically implement and validate all major **Route 53 DNS routing policies** in AWS. Through hands-on execution, I explored how each routing strategy works, enhancing my understanding of AWS networking and DNS management as part of my cloud learning.
